# Weather Prediction Classification Model

This repository contains a Python-based machine learning project focused on predicting weather conditions using classification techniques. The model is designed to forecast weather categories such as rain, fog, and clear days based on historical weather data.

## Project Overview

The project utilizes a dataset (`seattle-weather.csv`) containing historical weather observations to train a classification model that predicts future weather conditions. The model is built and tested in a Jupyter Notebook (`weather-prediction-classification-model.ipynb`), which includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation steps.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, normalizing data, and selecting relevant features.
- **Classification Model**: Implemented using popular machine learning libraries like scikit-learn.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessment of model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Visualization**: Graphical representation of data distribution, model predictions, and performance metrics.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-prediction-classification-model.git

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook weather-prediction-classification-model.ipynb
   
4. Run the cells in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project, (`seattle-weather.csv`), contains historical weather data for Seattle, including features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather type.

## Results

The model's performance is evaluated through various metrics, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting weather conditions. The results section in the notebook includes detailed analysis and visualizations of the model's predictions.
